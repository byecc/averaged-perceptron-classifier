Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . ||| 1
... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . ||| 1
The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . ||| 1

National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion ||| 0

Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . ||| 1
Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance . ||| 1

Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane . ||| 1
The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct . ||| 1
